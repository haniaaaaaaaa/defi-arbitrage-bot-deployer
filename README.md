**Hi! Decided to share my experience with this service.**

**October 11th** I got liquidated on futures because of Trump news. Trump imposed tariffs against China, then there was a stablecoin depegging on Binance — basically a huge crash and one of the biggest liquidations in crypto history. Lost almost everything I had. Only **0.93 ETH** left, and I didn't know what to do next.

Of course I was so smart — risked on futures, then cried about it. Classic! 😅

Stumbled upon this service by accident, decided to try it — couldn't get any worse. Put in my **0.93 ETH**, started the bot and forgot about it for a week. When I came back — already made back some money! Not everything, of course, but already showing a decent percentage per day. Works stable, interface is clear, commissions are low (**0.001%**).

**I recommend everyone to try this service** — especially if you understand DeFi and arbitrage. It's not a panacea, but works stable and gives decent passive income.

If you decide to use it — don't forget to enter my referral code **HGSHV6YR** when deploying. This will give you **0% commission** on the first 100 transactions, and me a small commission on your first 1000 transactions.

Good luck! 🚀
